    <h1>Native, Invasive, and Other Plant-Related Definitions</h1>

<h5>Native Plant</h5>

<blockquote><p>A plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed
over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or
ecosystem. Note: The word native should always be used with a
geographic qualifier (that is, native to New England [for example]).
Only plants found in this country before European settlement are
considered to be native to the United States.</p></blockquote>

<h5>Invasive Plant</h5>

<blockquote><p>A plant that is both non-native and able to establish on many sites,
grow quickly, and spread to the point of disrupting plant communities
or ecosystems. Note: From the Presidential Executive Order 13112
(February 1999): 'An invasive species is defined as a species that is
1) non-native (or alien) to the ecosystem under consideration and 2)
whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or
environmental harm or harm to human health.' In contrast to item 2) of
the Executive Order, which includes plants invasive in agricultural
settings, the Connecticut Invasive Plant Working Group lists
non-native plants as invasive only if they invade minimally managed
(natural) areas.</p></blockquote>

<h5>Non-Native Plant</h5>

<blockquote><p>A plant introduced with human help (intentionally or accidentally) to
a new place or new type of habitat where it was not previously found.
Note: Not all non-native plants are invasive. In fact, when many
non-native plants are introduced to new places, they cannot reproduce
or spread readily without continued human help (for example, many
ornamental plants).</p></blockquote>

<h5>Naturalized Plant</h5>

<blockquote><p>A non-native plant that does not need human help to reproduce and
maintain itself over time in an area where it is not native. Notes:
Even though their offspring reproduce and spread naturally (without
human help), naturalized plants do not, over time, become native
members of the local plant community. Many naturalized plants are
found primarily near human-dominated areas; and, sometimes,
naturalized is used (confusingly) to refer specifically to naturally
reproducing, non-native plants that do not invade areas dominated by
native vegetation. However, since invasive plants also reproduce and
spread without human help, they also are naturalized – invasives are a
small, but troublesome, sub-category of naturalized plants.</p></blockquote>

<h5>Exotic Plant</h5>

<blockquote><p>A plant not native to the continent on which it is now found. (Plants
from Europe are exotic in North America; plants from North America are
exotic in Japan.)</p></blockquote>

<h5>Translocated Plant</h5>

<blockquote><p>A plant not native to the portion of the continent where it is now
found. (California Poppies in New England are an example of a
translocated species.)</p></blockquote>

<h5>Opportunistic Native Plant</h5>

<blockquote><p>A native plant that is able to take advantage of disturbance to the
soil or existing vegetation to spread quickly and out-compete the
other plants on the disturbed site.</p></blockquote>

<h5>Weed</h5>

<blockquote><p>Common Usage - A weed is a plant (native or non-native) that is not
valued in the place where it is growing (USDA Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS)). Definition****- Any plant that poses a
major threat to agriculture and/or natural ecosystems within the
United States.</p></blockquote>

<h5>Noxious Weed</h5>

<blockquote><p>Common Usage - A plant that is particularly troublesome. Legal Context
(Federal Plant Protection Act) - Any plant or plant product that can
directly or indirectly injure or cause damage to crops (including
nursery stock or plant products), livestock, poultry or other
interests of agriculture, irrigation, navigation, the natural
resources of the United States, the public health, or the environment.
<em>Note: USDA APHIS maintains a list of federally-recognized noxious
weeds. It is illegal to import Federally listed noxious weeds or
transport them across state lines. Some states or counties maintain
lists and have passed laws regarding responsibilities for their
control (not applicable in Connecticut). Connecticut laws ban the sale
or transport of noxious weed seeds.</em></p>
