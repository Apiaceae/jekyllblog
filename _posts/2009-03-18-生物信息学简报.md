<em>Briefings in Bioinformatics</em> is an international forum for researchers and educators in the life sciences. The journal publishes reviews for the users of databases and analytical tools of contemporary genetics and molecular biology and is unique in providing practical help and guidance to the non-specialist.

<em>&quot;</em>Briefings in Bioinformatics <em>is a superb journal, and I find it to be an essential resource for staying current with the field of bioinformatics. The field of bioinformatics evolves at a rapid pace, and this journal rigorously describes current progress and often anticipates likely future developments. From a practical point of view, I use information from these articles in the laboratory and I also reference the journal in my teaching and publications.&quot;</em><br />
