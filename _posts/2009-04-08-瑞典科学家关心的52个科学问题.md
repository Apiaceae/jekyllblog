为了纪念分类学之父-瑞典博物学家林奈，瑞典的研究人员专门发起了名叫<a href="http://www.linnaeus300.com/home/">Linnaeus300的网站</a>。其中列举了目前瑞典科学家最关心的52个科学问题：

<div class="startModul" style="background-color: transparent">
<h2>question 1: how is nanotechnology changing our lives? </h2>
<div class="col1">
<a href="http://www.linnaeus300.com/the-questions/nanotechnology/"><img src="http://www.linnaeus300.com/images/thumb/2jpg_863.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="115" /></a>

Scientists are convinced that nanotechnology will enable us to monitor and control our own bodies in entirely new ways in the future. What will we be able to do ten years from now? Fifty years from now? <a href="http://www.linnaeus300.com/the-questions/nanotechnology/">&nbsp;Read&nbsp;more</a>

<h2>question 2: why do we have emotions? </h2>
<div class="col1">
<a href="http://www.linnaeus300.com/the-questions/why-do-we-have-emotions_212/"><img src="http://www.linnaeus300.com/images/thumb/3jpg_351.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="115" /></a> 
</div>
<div class="col2">
<p>
Joy, grief, gnawing anxiety... We have a rich spectrum of emotions which we often see as opposites to our ability to be rational. Why has evolution provided us with these apparently irrational &#39;disturbances&#39;? What&#39;s the point of feelings? <a href="http://www.linnaeus300.com/the-questions/why-do-we-have-emotions_212/">&nbsp;Read&nbsp;more</a>

<h2>question 3: how do flowers know when it&#39;s time to bloom? </h2>
<div class="col1">
<a href="http://www.linnaeus300.com/the-questions/how-do-flowers-know/"><img src="http://www.linnaeus300.com/images/thumb/4jpg_190.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="115" /></a> 
</div>
<div class="col2">
<p>
Plants lack consciousness. They cannot &quot;know&quot;, in our sense of the word, that it&#39;s time to bloom. A Swedish researcher has found the precise gene that controls plants&#39; flowering, thus solving a mystery that has been baffling biologists ever since the time of Carl Linnaeus. So exactly what is it that makes flowers open? <a href="http://www.linnaeus300.com/the-questions/how-do-flowers-know/">&nbsp;Read&nbsp;more</a>

<h2>question 4: can biology explain god? </h2>

</div>
<div class="col2">
<p>
Is man an image of God or is God a human invention? Leaving aside whether you&#39;re a believer or not, it&#39;s interesting to ask why so many people believe in God. Can we learn anything from biology? <a href="http://www.linnaeus300.com/the-questions/can-biology-explain-god_707/">&nbsp;Read&nbsp;more</a>

<h2>question 5: what&#39;s the smallest thing we can see? </h2>

<p>
Imagine you&#39;re out in space and scanning our solar system with your eyes. There&#39;s Eve, down on planet Earth, with an apple in her hand. Obviously you can&#39;t see her or the apple. Or can you? Nano scientists face the same astonishing size differences. The difference in size between the Earth and the apple is the same as the difference between the apple and a carbon atom in its peel! <a href="http://www.linnaeus300.com/the-questions/the-smallest-thing/">&nbsp;Read&nbsp;more</a>

<h2>question 6: what actually is a stem cell? </h2>

<div class="col2">
<p>
Stem cells are a medical raw material. They are as important for future medical science as forests have been for the paper industry. Without paper we wouldn&#39;t have any books. Without stem cells, we&#39;d perhaps have to go on classifying numerous diseases as incurable. <a href="http://www.linnaeus300.com/the-questions/stemcell/">&nbsp;Read&nbsp;more</a>

<h2>question 7: what&#39;s so unique about humans? </h2>

Asked &quot;what is a human being?&quot; a biologist will answer &quot;99% ape and 1% unknown&quot;. Only one single percent of our genetic material differentiates us from our nearest relative in the animal world, the chimpanzee. The latest research shows that this vital little one percent has to do with the brain... <a href="http://www.linnaeus300.com/the-questions/whats-so-unique-about-humans/">&nbsp;Read&nbsp;more</a>

<h2>question 8: how far may we go in manipulating plants? </h2>

<p>
As scientists successively reveal the genetic makeup of plants, they are also creating sharper tools for altering parts of the genetic code. What implications does this have? Advances are taking us further and further from what is &#39;natural&#39;. Can we keep up? <a href="http://www.linnaeus300.com/the-questions/manipulating-plants/">&nbsp;Read&nbsp;more</a>

<h2>question 9: why do children play? </h2>

Children laugh on average 400 times a day, adults 25 times. Why do we stop laughing? And why do we stop playing &ndash; most of us anyway? Is play simply a form of learning, a preparation for the future? <a href="http://www.linnaeus300.com/the-questions/why-do-children-play/">&nbsp;Read&nbsp;more</a>

<h2>question 10: how do we build new molecules? </h2>

Nanotechnology is sometimes called atomic carpentry. As if it were just as easy to assemble a new molecule as it is to nail together a box with a few pieces of wood. When these pieces of wood are only millionths of a millimetre in size you realise that it can&#39;t be that easy! <a href="http://www.linnaeus300.com/the-questions/new-molecules/">&nbsp;Read&nbsp;more</a>
