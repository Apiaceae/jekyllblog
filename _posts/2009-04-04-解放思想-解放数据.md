There is an interesting and <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7226/pdf/457129a.pdf">short editorial</a> in this weeks <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/index.html">Nature</a> about the closure of Google Research Datasets (formally part of Googles Palimpsest project which I learnt about in <a href="http://vsmith.info/SciFooHighlights">SciFoo2007</a> and later in <a href="http://vsmith.info/SciFoo-2008">SciFoo2008</a>). Despite the collapse, Amazon is getting into the business of hosting large research data sets for free, which (according to Nature) should inspire greater use of its <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3 cloud computing network</a>. For those who can&#39;t access Nature you don&#39;t need to read their editorial as their tag line says it all: 
</p>
<blockquote>
	&quot;<em>Initiatives for digital research infrastructure should focus more on making standardized data openly available, and less on developing new portals</em>.&quot; 
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a salient lesson for biodiversity initiatives such as <a href="http://www.e-taxonomy.eu/">EDIT</a>, <a href="http://www.eol.org/">EOL</a>, and (less so) <a href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/">BHL</a>. Set free the data and stop building data silos.
