<span style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman">The CATE (Creating a Taxonomic E-science) project, funded by the UK&rsquo;s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under their e-science programme, be&shy;gan in December 2005 and is a consortium of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, Natural History Museum London and the University of Oxford, Department of Zoology. CATE has its origins in a paper by Godfray (2002) which described the challenges facing taxonomy in the internet age, and suggested some avenues for innovation, including peer-reviewed consensus taxon&shy;omies. The CATE project was set up to test the feasibility of these ideas using pilot studies on two families, one botanical (Araceae, the aroids: </font><a href="http://www.cate-araceae.org/"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080">http:// </font></a><a href="http://www.cate-araceae.org/"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080">www.cate-araceae.org</font></a><font face="Times New Roman">) and one zoological (Sphingidae, the hawk moths: </font><a href="http://www.cate-sphingidae.org/"><font face="Times New Roman">http://www.cate-sphingidae.org</font></a><font face="Times New Roman"> ). In each case the goal is to build a site covering about 1,300 species using existing literature and collections to extract taxonomic and nomenclatural information, descriptions and keys, type specimen images, other images, literature references and links. </font></span><span style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman">The design of the software is based on existing taxonomic information models such as Taxon Concept Schema (TCS, </font><a href="http://www.tdwg.org/activities/tnc/tcs-schema-repository/"><font face="Times New Roman">http://www.tdwg.org/activities/tnc/ </font></a><a href="http://www.tdwg.org/activities/tnc/tcs-schema-repository/"><font face="Times New Roman">tcs-schema-repository/</font></a><font face="Times New Roman">), Structure of Descriptive Data (SDD, </font><a href="http://www.diversitycampus.net/Projects/TDWG-SDD/index.html"><font face="Times New Roman">http://www.diversitycampus.net/Projects/ </font></a><a href="http://www.diversitycampus.net/Projects/TDWG-SDD/index.html"><font face="Times New Roman">TDWG-SDD/index.html</font></a><font face="Times New Roman">), Access to Biological Collec&shy;tions Data (ABCD, </font><a href="http://www.bgbm.org/TDWG/CODATA/Schema/"><font face="Times New Roman">http://www.bgbm.org/TDWG/ </font></a><a href="http://www.bgbm.org/TDWG/CODATA/Schema/"><font face="Times New Roman">CODATA/Schema/</font></a><font face="Times New Roman">) and the Common Data Model (CDM, </font><a href="http://wp5.e-taxonomy.eu/EDIT-Architecture.html"><font face="Times New Roman">http://wp5.e-taxonomy.eu/EDIT-Architecture. </font></a><a href="http://wp5.e-taxonomy.eu/EDIT-Architecture.html"><font face="Times New Roman">html</font></a><font face="Times New Roman">). The aim is that the CATE software application will be generic, i.e. usable for other plant and animal groups. The CATE software architecture is database agnostic, i.e. it will work over a variety of different database formats and structures and the data is decoupled from on-screen delivery, which allows very ?exible presentation. The application is being built to facilitate integration with other frameworks such as GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility, </font><a href="http://www.gbif.org/"><font face="Times New Roman">http://www.gbif.org/</font></a><font face="Times New Roman">) and Encyclopedia of Life (EoL, </font><a href="http://www.eol.org/"><font face="Times New Roman">http://www.eol.org/</font></a><font face="Times New Roman">) through the use of LSIDs (Life Science Identi?ers) which are unique electronic tags for taxon concepts. </font></span><span style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman">The target audience consists of two broad user types; taxonomists who both produce and need access to information, and non-taxonomists whose primary inter&shy;est is to obtain access to information (although the system is open to anyone to make contributions). The management of the e-taxonomy website (the consensus taxonomy and any alternative hypotheses) can be divided into two main areas: content management, to be handled by the taxonomic community through an editorial body, and application management, which because of the costs of hosting and maintenance is probably only viable for appropriate major institutions such as natural history museums and herbaria. </font></span><span style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Any user can propose changes to the revision, and the decision whether to include them or not in the consensus classi?cation is made by review and modera&shy;tion carried out by members of the interested commu&shy;nity. Accepted proposals are incorporated into the next version of the consensus, but those that are rejected are nevertheless hosted on the site and visible as alternative hypotheses, attributed clearly to their authors. </font></span><span style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Contributions of non-moderated content are also an important component and already in the process of being implemented on the two taxon sites. This provides a way for people to contribute information, images or ideas that do not require community approval, but which are nevertheless of interest and will be credited to their authors. This type of content can potentially be incorporated into future versions of the consensus. </font></span><span style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman">We believe that the major innovation of CATE is its ambitious goal to provide software to implement a fully operational editing and peer-review system for proposals from the taxonomic community, making possible continuous update of consensus revisions. It focuses, more strongly than the other projects dis&shy;cussed here, on consensus taxonomies, peer-review and the integration of the relevant taxonomic com&shy;munity. The project also emphasises the provision of certain new features: illustrated interactive keys to all species and genera in the Araceae revision and a comprehensive set of standardised whole insect and genitalia images (the most critical morphological characters) in the case of the Sphingidae. </font></span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt"><font face="Times New Roman">This major project, funded by the Planetary Biodiver&shy;sity Inventory initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) as &ldquo;PBI Solanum: a worldwide treatment&rdquo;, has since 2004 been creating a new worldwide monograph of the large and economically important genus Solanum. The project is part of a much larger effort by the NSF to fund groups of taxonomists working on alpha-taxonomy and making it available electronically on the web &mdash; the PBI initiative began in 2002. PBI Solanum has brought together an international team of taxonomic special&shy;ists of the family Solanaceae along with students and collaborators, and the website is currently managed at the Natural History Museum, London.
