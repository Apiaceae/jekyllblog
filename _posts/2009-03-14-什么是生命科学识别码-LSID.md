<strong>Life Science Identifiers</strong> (<strong>LSIDs</strong>) are persistent, location-independent, resource identifiers for uniquely naming biologically significant resources including species names, concepts, occurrences, genes or proteins, or data objects that encode information about them. To put it simply, LSIDs are a way to identify and locate pieces of biological information on the web. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The <strong>LSID </strong>concept introduces a straightforward approach to naming and identifying data resources stored in multiple, distributed data stores in a manner that overcomes the limitations of naming schemes in use today. Almost every public, internal, or department-level data store today has its own way of naming individual data resources, making integration between different data sources a tedious, never-ending chore for informatics developers and researchers. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
By defining a simple, common way to identify and access biologically significant data, whether that data is stored in files, relational databases, in applications, or in internal or public data sources, <strong>LSID </strong>provides a naming standard underpinning for wide-area science and interoperability.
