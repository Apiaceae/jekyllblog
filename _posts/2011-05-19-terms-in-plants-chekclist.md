Native, Invasive, and Other Plant-Related Definitions
=====================================================

##### Native Plant

> A plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed
> over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or
> ecosystem. Note: The word native should always be used with a
> geographic qualifier (that is, native to New England [for example]).
> Only plants found in this country before European settlement are
> considered to be native to the United States.

##### Invasive Plant

> A plant that is both non-native and able to establish on many sites,
> grow quickly, and spread to the point of disrupting plant communities
> or ecosystems. Note: From the Presidential Executive Order 13112
> (February 1999): 'An invasive species is defined as a species that is
> 1) non-native (or alien) to the ecosystem under consideration and 2)
> whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or
> environmental harm or harm to human health.' In contrast to item 2) of
> the Executive Order, which includes plants invasive in agricultural
> settings, the Connecticut Invasive Plant Working Group lists
> non-native plants as invasive only if they invade minimally managed
> (natural) areas.

##### Non-Native Plant

> A plant introduced with human help (intentionally or accidentally) to
> a new place or new type of habitat where it was not previously found.
> Note: Not all non-native plants are invasive. In fact, when many
> non-native plants are introduced to new places, they cannot reproduce
> or spread readily without continued human help (for example, many
> ornamental plants).

##### Naturalized Plant

> A non-native plant that does not need human help to reproduce and
> maintain itself over time in an area where it is not native. Notes:
> Even though their offspring reproduce and spread naturally (without
> human help), naturalized plants do not, over time, become native
> members of the local plant community. Many naturalized plants are
> found primarily near human-dominated areas; and, sometimes,
> naturalized is used (confusingly) to refer specifically to naturally
> reproducing, non-native plants that do not invade areas dominated by
> native vegetation. However, since invasive plants also reproduce and
> spread without human help, they also are naturalized – invasives are a
> small, but troublesome, sub-category of naturalized plants.

##### Exotic Plant

> A plant not native to the continent on which it is now found. (Plants
> from Europe are exotic in North America; plants from North America are
> exotic in Japan.)

##### Translocated Plant

> A plant not native to the portion of the continent where it is now
> found. (California Poppies in New England are an example of a
> translocated species.)

##### Opportunistic Native Plant

> A native plant that is able to take advantage of disturbance to the
> soil or existing vegetation to spread quickly and out-compete the
> other plants on the disturbed site.

##### Weed

> Common Usage - A weed is a plant (native or non-native) that is not
> valued in the place where it is growing (USDA Animal and Plant Health
> Inspection Service (APHIS)). Definition****- Any plant that poses a
> major threat to agriculture and/or natural ecosystems within the
> United States.

##### Noxious Weed

> Common Usage - A plant that is particularly troublesome. Legal Context
> (Federal Plant Protection Act) - Any plant or plant product that can
> directly or indirectly injure or cause damage to crops (including
> nursery stock or plant products), livestock, poultry or other
> interests of agriculture, irrigation, navigation, the natural
> resources of the United States, the public health, or the environment.
> *Note: USDA APHIS maintains a list of federally-recognized noxious
> weeds. It is illegal to import Federally listed noxious weeds or
> transport them across state lines. Some states or counties maintain
> lists and have passed laws regarding responsibilities for their
> control (not applicable in Connecticut). Connecticut laws ban the sale
> or transport of noxious weed seeds.*
