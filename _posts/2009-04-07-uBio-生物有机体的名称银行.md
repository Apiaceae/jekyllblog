有机体的信息经常通过名称来管理
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://www.ubio.org/images/elephantExample.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="268" height="257" align="right" />Information about organisms is often <a href="http://www.ubio.org/index.php?pagename=data_objects">linked to a name</a>. 
</p>
<p>
This can create problems in <a href="http://www.ubio.org/index.php?pagename=IR_problems">information retrieval</a> because:
</p>
<p>
&bull; One taxon can have <a href="http://www.ubio.org/index.php?pagename=problem_names">many names</a>.
</p>
<p>
&bull; The same name can refer to <a href="http://www.ubio.org/index.php?pagename=types_concepts">many taxa</a>.
</p>
<p>
uBio is working on tools for providers of biological information that address these problems.
</p>
<p>
The uBio <strong>Taxonomic Name Server</strong> acts as a name thesaurus. 
</p>
<p>
Names have many <a href="http://www.ubio.org/index.php?pagename=name_properties">different classes of relationships</a> that can be used to organize and retrieve information that is annotated with names. These classes are divided into two inter-connected services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>NameBank</strong> is a repository of millions of recorded biological names and facts that link those names together. [<a href="http://www.ubio.org/index.php?pagename=nb_facts_opinions">more</a>]
</p>
<p>
<strong>ClassificationBank</strong> stores multiple classifications and <a href="http://www.ubio.org/index.php?pagename=taxon_concepts">taxonomic concepts</a> that are the result of expert opinions. It extends the functionality of NameBank. [<a href="http://www.ubio.org/index.php?pagename=clsbank">more</a>]
</p>
<p>
All data within these components are linked to mechanisms that provide credit and attribution to experts who provide name and linkage information within the TNS. [<a href="http://www.ubio.org/index.php?pagename=attribution">more</a>]
</p>
<p>
Lastly, NameBank promotes the emergence of a layered biological informatics infrastructure that allows <a href="http://www.ubio.org/index.php?pagename=other_initiatives">different expert systems</a> to share common information. This conserves scarce resources and enhances the means to support continued expert work. [<a href="http://www.ubio.org/index.php?pagename=split">more</a>]
