<span>BioNET is an international not-for-profit initiative dedicated to promoting taxonomy, especially in the biodiversity rich but economically poorer countries of the world. Working via local partnerships (LOOPs), BioNET strives to provide a forum for collaboration that is equally open to all taxonomists and to the other users of taxonomy. Working with partners locally and internationally, our work contributes to raising awareness of the importance of taxonomy to society, building and sharing of capacity, and meeting taxonomic needs via innovative tools and approaches. <span>&nbsp; </span></span>

Our affiliated partnerships are uniquely positioned to identify and help meet local taxonomic needs relating to sustainable development and conservation, in particular needs relating to the Millennium Development Goals and the 2010 target to significantly reduce the rate of loss of biodiversity.</span>
