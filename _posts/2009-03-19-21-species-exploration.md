__Taxonomists__ discover, describe and classify *species*. Millions of species remain unknown or unidentifiable, inaccessible to science and society. 

Charting the species of the world and their unique attributes are essential parts of understanding the **history of life**.

Reliable taxonomic information is a necessary for managing sustainable ecosystems, attaining conservation goals, and detecting introductions of pests, vectors and invasive species. 

__Traditional taxonomic tools__ and methods have theoretical rigor and rich intellectual content, but are not keeping pace with this growing need for knowledge. 

**How can we increase the pace at which species exploration progresses while maintaining the scientific rigor of traditional taxonomy?**
